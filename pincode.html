    <p> we will be creating a Pincode Details Finder using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

        The Pincode Details Finder will allow users to enter a Pincode and retrieve the details of the corresponding location. We will be using an API to fetch the details of the location based on the entered Pincode.
        
        Let's get started!
        
        Setting Up the HTML
        The first step is to create the basic structure of our HTML page. We will create an input field where users can enter the Pincode and a button to initiate the search. We will also create a container to display the details of the location.
        
        Fetching Data Using API
        Next, we will use an API to fetch the details of the location based on the entered Pincode. We will be using the Post Office API for this purpose.
        
        We then construct the API URL by appending the Pincode to the base URL. We then use the fetch function to make a GET request to the API.
        
        Once we get the response, we convert it to JSON using the json() method. We then check if the response status is Success or not. If it is Success, we extract the details of the first Post Office from the response and pass it to the displayDetails function. If the response status is not Success, we display an error message using the displayError function.
        
        We start by defining the searchPincode function, which is triggered when the user clicks the "Search" button. In this function, we first retrieve the entered Pincode from the input field. We then construct the API URL by appending the Pincode to the base URL. We then use the fetch function to make a GET request to the API.
        
        Once we get the response, we convert it to JSON using the json() method. We then check if the response status is Success or not. If it is Success, we extract the details of the first Post Office from the response and pass it to the displayDetails function. If the response status is not Success, we display an error message using the displayError function.
